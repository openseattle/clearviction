                            The purpose of keeping posts in the right channel is two-fold: it ensures that only the
                            right people are informed of the post AND it keeps everyone interested in being part of the
                            conversation informed.

                            There’s so much going on! In some channels, there will be a lot of people posting. To reply
                            in a thread, hover over their post and look for a speech bubble to appear on the right. This
                            creates a thread that keeps sub-conversations in one place.

                                assist. We may @ someone else in the thread we consider the request.

                                working on it, that we can’t be of assistance, or that we’ve seen the request and intend
                                to act on it at a specific time (immediately followed by transferring the activity to
                                the relevant task management system, of course).

                                little reaction to indicate that the message landed.
