                            conversation informed.

                            There’s so much going on! In some channels, there will be a lot of people posting. To reply
                            in a thread, hover over their post and look for a speech bubble to appear on the right. This
                            creates a thread that keeps sub-conversations in one place.
                        </p>

                            Keep in mind that ONLY people who have commented on the thread itself are likely (but not
                            guaranteed) to be notified of your comment unless you @ them directly. This creates a nice
                            little corner of Slack for you to have a conversation in that:
                        </p>

                                assist. We may @ someone else in the thread we consider the request.

                                working on it, that we can’t be of assistance, or that we’ve seen the request and intend
                                to act on it at a specific time (immediately followed by transferring the activity to
                                the relevant task management system, of course).

                                little reaction to indicate that the message landed.
