                    When applying for aid, you will be asked whether you had a drug conviction for an offense that
                    occurred while you were receiving federal student aid. If the answer is yes, you will be provided a
                    worksheet to help you determine whether your conviction affects your eligibility for federal student
                    aid. Note: this restriction only applies if you were already receiving federal student aid when you
                    were convicted.

                <Typography variant="body2">
                    Even if you are not immediately eligible, this may not be permanent. For example, if you have a
                    conviction for possession, your eligibility for financial aid resumes after one year for a first
                    offense or two years for a second offense. After a third offense, you will remain ineligible
                    indefinitely. For a sale conviction, eligibility resumes after two years for a first offense, but
                    ineligibility is indefinite for a second offense.

                <Typography variant="body2">
                    If your eligibility for federal student aid has been suspended due to a drug conviction, you can
                    regain eligibility early by successfully completing an approved drug rehabilitation program or by
                    passing two unannounced drug tests administered by an approved drug rehabilitation program. If you
                    regain eligibility during the award year, notify your financial aid office immediately.

                period of incarceration for that offense, you cannot receive a Federal Pell Grant.
