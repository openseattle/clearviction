                        Vacating a conviction is the process of clearing a conviction from your record so it is not
                        visible to the public any more. Vacating your conviction can remove that crime from some
                        background checks, and you can say legally that you were never convicted of that crime.

                    <Typography className={classes.contentTextStyle}>
                        The courts can still reference a vacated conviction in a future criminal proceeding, and not all
                        convictions are eligible for vacation.

                        If you are convicted of a crime, your criminal record will continue to show that conviction in
                        background checks. Having a criminal record might negatively affect your housing, employment,
                        and educational opportunities.

                    <Typography className={classes.contentTextStyle}>
                        If you are experiencing this, vacating your conviction removes that crime from background
                        checks, and you can say legally that you were never convicted of that crime. This can help you
                        get access to housing, education, employment, volunteering opportunities, and more.
